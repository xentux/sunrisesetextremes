# Sun rise and set extremes

Uses [skyfield python module](https://pypi.org/project/skyfield/) to calculate sun rise and set extrema at a given observation point for a given year.  

**Note:** These results are overly precise and the actual time the Sun may be first or last seen depends heavily on atmospheric conditions and may vary by a minute or more.

Forked from [rtphokie/sunrisesetextremes](https://github.com/rtphokie/sunrisesetextremes).

## Improvements
- *Fixed*: Bug in *risesetextremes* occuring with eastern (positive) longitudes.
- *Fixed*: Removed a few dots (".") at the end of a code line.
- *Improved*: Removed unnecessary libraries
- *Improved*: Moved a few configurations to 'static' variables at the beginning of the code.
- Moved requirement and environment management to poetry.
